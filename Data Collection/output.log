TITLE : Experimental Algorithms
DESCRIPTION : Many ?real world? problems are NP-Hard and therefore do not admit efficient algorithms that obtain optimal solutions. Thus it is important to be able to assess the behavior of heuristics [no guarantee of optimality] and algorithms [guaranteed optimality but no guarantees on runtime] with respect to solution quality and execution time. There are also problems that do have polynomial time algorithms but the best choice among several such algorithms is unclear, either because all have the same asymptotic runtime or because the asymptotic runtime, due to large constants, may not be indicative of actual runtime. The goal of this course is to explore these issues in a hands-on fashion, via a project that addresses a particular problem. Prerequisites: CSC 316 [for undergraduates] CSC 505 [for graduate students] or a data structures and algorithms course similar to one of these.

TITLE : Game AI
DESCRIPTION : Prerequisites-495: CSC316 The purpose of this course is to familiarize students with issues and techniques of Artificial Intelligence [AI] for computer games. For nearly 60 years, games have been a standard application area for artificial intelligence techniques. Indeed, some of the earliest AI techniques were designed to play games that humans excelled at: Checkers, Backgammon, Chess, and Go to name a few. While the more general AI goal of human-level intelligence has remained elusive, computer scientists have developed techniques that enable computers to play certain games at or beyond the level of the world's best human players. In fact, many game designers intentionally dumb down their AI opponents using techniques such as artificial stupidity or intelligent mistakes to create game experiences that human players find challenging, rather than impossible. In this course we will examine both traditional and modern AI techniques that are used in the design of computer games. We will look at techniques for game playing as well as the design of AI opponents tasked with creating good experiences for players. The course will begin with a discussion of AI in general, as well as common algorithms, data structures, and representations. From there, we will cover topics in character movement, pathfinding, decision making, strategy, tactics, and learning---all within the context of computer games. Students will be given three or four multi-week homework assignments, or mini-projects, related to the lecture material. These assignments will require students to implement and/or evaluate some of the algorithms or techniques we are covering during course lectures. In addition, students enrolled in the graduate section of the course will conduct a semester-long project that will be reviewed by students in the undergraduate section of the course. All students will additionally be evaluated with a midterm and a final exam.

DESCRIPTION : Description: In 2006, AOL released user search logs stripped of email addresses, account holder names and other explicitly identifying information. The New York Times promptly examined the queries in the data and identified user 4417749 as a 62 year old resident of Lilburn, GA [1]. This is one of many `reidentification? attacks. More recently, researchers have shown how pseudonymous eBay users can be identified [2] and how Netflix users can be identified from their movie ratings [3]. When hearing about privacy breaches like these, it?s natural to ask what technology is available to users to protect their privacy. It?s important to consider not only the technical functionality of privacy-enhancing technologies [PETs] but also usability and the user experience -- all impact adoption. Hillary Clinton?s use of a personal email account for government business [4] demonstrates the strong influence usability can have on privacy/security choices. In this course, we will study how to use data in a principled way to understand privacy risk, attitudes and concerns. We will focus on several of the attacks, PETs and privacy measurement techniques behind this research and press, in particular:

TITLE : Visual Interfaces for Mobile Devices
DESCRIPTION : If you need department consent to enroll ... contact Dr. Adams in the Undergraduate Advisor's Office. Prerequisites: CSC 454 [HCI] or CSC 461 [Graphics] or consent of the instructor This course provides an introduction to mobile phone technology, and experience designing and implementing graphics and user interfaces in a limited display and input environment. My goals for you are to: ? gain an understanding of the basic hardware and software designs used in modern smartphones ? explore graphics and interface design decisions and tradeoffs on modern smartphones ? gain experience designing and implementing an application with significant graphics and/or UI requirements using Android OS. The graded material of this course is a full semester project, completed by groups of 2-3 students, and a final exam. The course project will be designed and implemented for the Android OS, implemented to run on cell phones running Android. Each group will be responsible for choosing a topic for their course project. Because this course focuses on graphics and interface for limited-capability devices and environments, your project is required to have a significant graphics or UI component. So, it would not be appropriate, for example, to propose to re-implement a simplified version of Android's contact list as your course project. Possible topics could include [but are not limited to]: ? games ? visualization ? improved input methods for common interactions or an existing application ? improved interface for an existing application

TITLE : Evaluation of Intelligent Game Design Techniques
DESCRIPTION : CSC591-004 Evaluation of Intelligent Game Design Techniques ? Dr. roberts As hardware technologies mature and players' expectations of computer games and entertainment experiences increase, the challenges for designers continue to grow as well. Modern computer games ship only after the efforts of large teams of artists, coders, and designers are coordinated to produce a coherent product. These teams are needed to produce artifacts of increasing complexity and scope that have come to be expected in computer games. Game designers and academics alike have been increasingly turning toward artificial intelligence techniques as tools to both create more engaging/interesting/complex game experiences and to enable the teams of programmers to produce these experiences with less effort. In this course we will examine AI and ML algorithms for computer games as well as techniques for effectively evaluating these algorithms. We will look both at how these algorithms can be used to engineer intelligence into games and how these methods can reduce the effort required to design and implement games. Although there are games in which computers play head-to-head, in this course we will focus on games as a playable artifact for humans. In doing so, we will evaluate the AI and ML techniques we study from a user's [either player's or designer's] perspective. Topics involving user studies and human computer interaction techniques will also be discussed, including study design, evaluation metrics, and basic statistics for data analysis of user studies. We will read papers from the literature in AI, ML, HCI, and games. Students will primarily be evaluated using a semester-long group project on a topic of their choosing [approved by the instructor]. There are no formal prerequisites; however, familiarity with the topics from a graduate-level artificial intelligence or machine learning course and/or a graduate level human computer interaction course are highly encouraged.

TITLE : Experimental Algorithms
DESCRIPTION : Many ?real world? problems are NP-Hard and therefore do not admit efficient algorithms that obtain optimal solutions. Thus it is important to be able to assess the behavior of heuristics [no guarantee of optimality] and algorithms [guaranteed optimality but no guarantees on runtime] with respect to solution quality and execution time. There are also problems that do have polynomial time algorithms but the best choice among several such algorithms is unclear, either because all have the same asymptotic runtime or because the asymptotic runtime, due to large constants, may not be indicative of actual runtime. The goal of this course is to explore these issues in a hands-on fashion, via a project that addresses a particular problem. Prerequisites: CSC 316 [for undergraduates] CSC 505 [for graduate students] or a data structures and algorithms course similar to one of these.

Blurb: Most software companies now learn their policies via data-driven methods. Modern practitioners treat every planned feature as an experiment, of which only a few are expected to survive. Key performance metrics are carefully monitored and analyzed to judge the progress of a feature. Even simple design decisions such as the color of a link are chosen by the outcome of software experiments. This subject will explore methods for designing data collection experiments; collecting that data; exploring that data; then presenting that data in such a way to support business-level decision making for software projects.

TITLE : Game AI
DESCRIPTION : Prerequisites-591: Graduate standing in Computer Science, or undergraduate in ABM The purpose of this course is to familiarize students with issues and techniques of Artificial Intelligence [AI] for computer games. For nearly 60 years, games have been a standard application area for artificial intelligence techniques. Indeed, some of the earliest AI techniques were designed to play games that humans excelled at: Checkers, Backgammon, Chess, and Go to name a few. While the more general AI goal of human-level intelligence has remained elusive, computer scientists have developed techniques that enable computers to play certain games at or beyond the level of the world's best human players. In fact, many game designers intentionally dumb down their AI opponents using techniques such as artificial stupidity or intelligent mistakes to create game experiences that human players find challenging, rather than impossible. In this course we will examine both traditional and modern AI techniques that are used in the design of computer games. We will look at techniques for game playing as well as the design of AI opponents tasked with creating good experiences for players. The course will begin with a discussion of AI in general, as well as common algorithms, data structures, and representations. From there, we will cover topics in character movement, pathfinding, decision making, strategy, tactics, and learning---all within the context of computer games. Students will be given three or four multi-week homework assignments, or mini-projects, related to the lecture material. These assignments will require students to implement and/or evaluate some of the algorithms or techniques we are covering during course lectures. In addition, students enrolled in the graduate section of the course will conduct a semester-long project that will be reviewed by students in the undergraduate section of the course. All students will additionally be evaluated with a midterm and a final exam.

TITLE : Software Defined Networking
DESCRIPTION : Software Defined Networking: The newly emerged paradigm of Software Defined Networking brings together long-standing concepts with recent ones, and promises to change every aspect of the practice of networking in the decade to come. In this special topic, we will investigate the basic concepts, and discuss various architectural flavors, of SDN. We shall delve a little deeper in OpenFlow, a fairly popular open implementation of an SDN architecture. We will also study other models, and discuss the comparative role of various system components in such models. Beyond lecture material, students will be assigned reading from the research literature on the subject, and available open-source material. Students will be required to complete homework assignments based on their reading, and will also need to perform hands-on exercises, largely in virtual networking labs. Students will also need to undertake a half-semester long project in the latter part of the semester that requires them to build an SDN network targeted at specific functionality. For 700-level students, this project is required to be designed to investigate an open question in the study of SDNs, while for 500-level students, it is allowed to be a replication of a known system configuration in order to assess performance characteristics. After taking the course, students will be able to articulate the fundamental concepts behind an SDN architecture, compare and predict performance characteristics of SDN-based networks as opposed to traditional internetworks, realize an OpenFlow network to specifications. Students taking the 700-level version will in addition be able to design an SDN system experiment to investigate cutting-edge questions in SDN. Good knowledge of Internet architecture and protocols, practical Internet application programming experience, and familiarity with Linux networking, are very strongly desirable background for this course. In particular, having successfully taken CSC/ECE 573 [Internet Protocols] would be good preparation for this special topic.

TITLE : Machine Learning for User-Adaptive Systems
DESCRIPTION : Machine Learning is concerned with computer programs that enable the behavior of a computer to be learned from examples or experience rather than dictated through rules written by hand. An important scientific phenomenon in the 21st century has been the advances made possible by mining the wealth of user data available from various interactive systems. Machine learning and data mining methods can greatly improve the effectiveness and adaptiveness of interactive systems, and user-system interaction data in turn exposes new machine learning and data mining challenges. This class is meant to teach the practical side of machine learning for mining interactive data, such as mining user log ?les to make predictions, discovering interesting patterns from the sequential data, or building adaptive user interactive systems. In this class, students will learn how to mine user-system interaction data and to make interactive systems more intelligent by adapting to users? individual needs in many different situations. Students will see applications of decision-theoretic systems, Hidden Markov Models, the expectation-maximization algorithm, sequential factor analysis, Markov models for action selection, and reinforcement learning. Students will read papers that apply machine learning and data mining techniques to user adaptation. Students will also complete a project that applies these techniques to build an adaptive interactive system.

TITLE : Natural Language Dialogue Systems
DESCRIPTION : CSC791-001 Natural language dialogue systems Dr. Boyer Natural language dialogue is a rich and expressive means of communication. Computer-based dialogue systems that leverage this communication medium are increasingly prevalent: they are used in mobile devices, customer support call centers, intelligent tutoring systems, and many other applications. These dialogue systems face significant challenges; for example, user language is noisy and difficult to understand, as are user goals and plans. Determining appropriate responses, along with when to take the initiative, are pivotal concerns. This course covers foundational issues for dialogue systems such as dialogue management and language understanding. Additionally, the course explores other areas of the dialogue system research space including affective and multimodal considerations and human-robot dialogue. Particular emphasis is placed on machine learning approaches, both supervised and unsupervised. The goal of the course is to prepare students to conduct research in textual or spoken natural language dialogue, or to enhance their existing research with computational linguistics approaches. 791 Prerequisites: Statistics [ST 370 or equivalent] or Artificial Intelligence [CSC 411 or equivalent] plus a graduate course in data mining [CSC 522 or equivalent], machine learning [CSC 722 or equivalent] or consent of instructor<br ></a>Class is restricted to students with graduate standing in Computer Networking [Computer Science], or Computer Science
