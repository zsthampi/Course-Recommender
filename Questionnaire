1. 70% students major in computer science in their undergraduate.

2. - 25% students come to explore and study a variety of subjects. 
   - Over 50% students are interested in multiple specialization

3. Resources: All the resources mentioned were important to at least some of the students. 
We tried to split it into 2 groups based on what the majority of students felt were important. 
   -Very important:
   seniors' suggestions, projects/reserches, contect, workload
   -Generally important:
   grade distribution, job prospect, professor ratings, frequency, pre-requisite, the experience of the first class.
      
4. Accessiblity: From the survey, we found the following resouces to be the ones students felt were not accessible during the first semester
   - grade distribution, professor ratings, workload, frequency

5. University Resources 

	- Only 50% of the students though the University provided enough information for new students about selecting courses
	- We also invited comments from students on this which revelead the majority of issues that exist in this front 
	- 1. Info is available, but it needs to be more accessible 
	- 2. Students feel that the details about course-work and workload of the course is not accurate (It is either partially available or not available at all)
	- 3. There is no system of Course Reviews accessible to students
	- 4. Online video lectures are a good way to get a preview of the class. Atleast 1 video lecture of courses/professors should be made accessible to students to preview. This could be a good substitute to trying out classes on the first day. 

6. Satisfaction with the courses taken in First semester 

	- Even with data suggesting the data is not easily available, 70% of the students suggested that they were finally satisfied with the courses that they took in the first semester 
	- It is indicative, that students do find ways around to research about the courses. The info does exist, we just need to make it more accessible to new students

FINAL SUGGESTIONS 
-----------------
1. We need to have a better way to estimate workload of a course, course content and reviews. 
Making online lecture videos available for preview is one option. 
Although a lot of students felt suggestions from peers/seniors were available, we could better solve this issue by connecting people who are doing the same specialization. Or people who have taken the course before. 

2. Information is available, but not that accessible to the students. 
We could create a General Information Page to maintain the info centrally.
