List of Project Ideas
=====================

1. Simple ways to draw a graph online 
	- It is a requirement in Algorithm/Graph related Computer Science courses 
	- draw.io covers most of the requirements
	- not much scope of research/improvement

2. Time scheduler for a group
	- Find free time slots of a group by comparing their calendars 
	- Find if library rooms are available for grabs in the free hours easily
	- Prior notifications, if library rooms are being booked out (say at 80% of available)

3. [FINAL] Better Course Reviews and suggestions at NCSU	
- Currently, people try out different courses at the start of semester, to get a feel of the class 
	- Is there any way we could provide better suggestions and reviews to students who are looking for it? (Especially students in their first semester)
	- How does a fresher determine the courses that could be beneficial for his choice of specialization/career? 
	
	
	Target Users: 
	1. Freshers (CSC Masters Students).
	2. Currently enrolled (subsequent semesters).
	
	Baseline. 
	1. Which course is better/ easier/ quality/ balance/ project-oriented/ value for money for a particular specialization. 
	2. Which are the fundamental courses one should take during the first semester (covers pre-requisites?). 
	3. How often is a course offered ? (special courses)
	
4. A study on "Contact Us" on websites and services
	- Rewind 10 years, there were email IDs and telephone numbers on Contact Us page for almost every website 
	- Gradually it changed to forms for getting data 
	- Then, we saw an advent of automated voice messages to address concerns on telecom/banking websites
	- Recently, I tried to report an unfair charge on my UBER account, and they gave me credits for the charged amount instantly. ABSOLUTELY NO QUESTIONS ASKED! Do companies want to do away with allocating resources on solving issues? (Often petty), or answering questions? (Often asked a 100 times over)
	- Can we come up with a general solution for "Contact Us" which can be applied to software services.
