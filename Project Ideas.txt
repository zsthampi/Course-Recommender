List of Project Ideas
=====================

1. Simple ways to draw a graph online 
	- It is a requirement in Algorithm/Graph related Computer Science courses 
	- draw.io covers most of the requirements
	- not much scope of research/improvement

2. Time scheduler for a group
	- Find free time slots of a group by comparing their calendars 
	- Find if library rooms are available for grabs in the free hours easily
	- Prior notifications, if library rooms are being booked out (say at 80% of available)

3. Better Course Reviews and suggestions at NCSU
	- Currently, people try out different courses at the start of semester, to get a feel of the class 
	- Is there any way we could provide better suggestions and reviews to students who are looking for it? (Especially students in their first semester)
	- How does a fresher determine the courses that could be beneficial for his choice of specialization/career? 
	
	
	Target Users: 
	1. Freshers (CSC Masters Students).
	2. Currently enrolled (subsequent semesters).
	
	Baseline. 
	1. Which course is better/ easier/ quality/ balance/ project-oriented/ value for money for a particular specialization. 
	2. Which are the fundamental courses one should take during the first semester (covers pre-requisites?). 
	3. How often is a course offered ? (special courses)
